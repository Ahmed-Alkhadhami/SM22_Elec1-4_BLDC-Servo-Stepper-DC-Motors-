# Stepper Motor :
This is a Stepper Motor circuit , which has been controlled via an Arduino directly , or using a motor driver (A4988).
The task is done with the help of www.wokwi.com simulation.


## Repository Contents :
The task is done first via the motor driver (A4988) to control the process between the Stepper motor and the arduino ,then by connecting the Stepper motor directly to the arduino.
